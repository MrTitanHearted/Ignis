# Ignis - Build Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before building Ignis, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **vcpkg** – for dependency management.
   [https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)

2. **VCPKG_CMAKE environment variable** – points to the `vcpkg.cmake` file generated by:

   ```bash
   vcpkg integrate install
   ```

3. **CMake** – version 3.20 or higher recommended.
   [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)

4. **C++ 20 Compiler** – any working C++ 20 compiler.

    * Tested with **GCC** and **Clang** on Linux.
    * Should work with MSVC on Windows.

5. **Vulkan SDK** – for Vulkan headers and libraries.

## Build Instructions

### 1. Generate build files

Run the following command from the root of the Ignis repository:

```bash
cmake -S <Ignis repository> -B <build directory> \
      [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release] \
      [-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON|OFF]
```

* `<Ignis repository>`: path to the Ignis source directory.
* `<build directory>`: path to the directory where build files will be generated.
* `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` (optional): `Debug` (default) or `Release`.
* `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` (optional): `OFF` by default, set `ON` for shared libraries.

> Example:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

### 2. Build the project

After generating the build files, compile the project with:

```bash
cmake --build <build directory> --parallel <num_of_cores>
```

* `<build directory>`: the same directory you specified in the previous step.
* `<num_of_cores>`: number of logical CPU cores for parallel compilation (e.g., `8`).

> Example:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel 8
```

### 3. Run Ignis

After a successful build, the executable should be located inside the build directory (e.g., `build/`). Run it directly:

```bash
./build/Ignis
```

## Notes

* Make sure `VCPKG_CMAKE` environment variable is set correctly before running `cmake`.
* On Linux, you may need additional Vulkan development packages (`vulkan-sdk` or `libvulkan-dev`).
* For Windows, ensure that your compiler toolchain (MSVC/MinGW) is correctly configured in CMake.
